# Decimal Agent Payments Scorecard

Source basis:

- Colosseum Copilot project search across 5 adjacent queries
- Colosseum Copilot cluster summaries
- Colosseum Copilot winner-vs-field comparison
- Colosseum Copilot archive search

Raw artifact:

- `outputs/copilot_agent_payments.json`

## Market snapshot from Copilot

- `33` unique comparable projects surfaced across the five searches.
- The space is not empty. But the exact wedge is still underbuilt.
- Most results fall into one of four buckets:
  - simple payment rails / Solana Pay wrappers
  - x402 / agent-payment infra experiments
  - subscription / recurring billing tools
  - generic merchant monetization layers

### Most relevant surfaced competitors

- `Solana a2a payment`
- `MCPay`
- `x402 SDK for Solana`
- `Slotcast`
- `Latinum Agentic Commerce`
- `BLOCKSUB`
- `LinkWave`
- `Bundl`
- `DePlan`
- `PALAPA`
- `Aeon Protocol`

### Relevant clusters

- `v1-c26` Simplified Solana Payment Solutions: `223` projects, `9` winners
- `v1-c16` Stablecoin Payment Rails and Infrastructure: `202` projects, `20` winners
- `v1-c14` Solana AI Agent Infrastructure: `325` projects, `14` winners
- `v1-c5` Solana Data and Monitoring Infrastructure: `257` projects, `31` winners

Interpretation:

- Payments alone are crowded.
- AI agents alone are crowded.
- The specific overlap of `agent payments + merchant billing + operational layer` is less crowded than the broader surrounding clusters.
- That is the gap.

## Scorecard

| Dimension | Rating (/10) | Read | Evidence |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| Novelty | 5.5 | The category is not novel anymore. The exact product cut is still somewhat differentiated. | Copilot surfaced `33` comparable projects, including x402, subscriptions, agent commerce, and merchant payments. Direct protocol/infra experiments already exist. |
| Market Timing | 8.5 | Strong timing. Protocol and research momentum are converging now. | Archive hits include a16z and Galaxy research on agent payments, x402, and stablecoin-backed B2B/agent commerce. |
| Competitive Gap | 6.5 | There is a gap, but it is not empty. The gap is merchant operations, not raw rails. | Search results skew toward rails, Solana Pay wrappers, and recurring-billing primitives. Very few look like a Stripe-like merchant operating system. |
| Mechanism Design | 7.5 | Strong if Decimal stays on the operating layer and composes MPP/x402 instead of inventing another rail. | MPP covers one-shot + session logic; x402 covers simple 402 paywalls. Your mechanism advantage is billing state, reconciliation, proofs, and merchant UX. |
| Accelerator Overlap | 4.0 | Weak-to-moderate accelerator pull from current evidence. | Top surfaced matches mostly had `accelerator: null`. The concept is plausible for accelerator interest, but Copilot did not show a strong existing accelerator cluster around this exact wedge. |
| Hackathon Precedent | 7.0 | Plenty of precedent for pieces of the stack. | Projects like `MCPay`, `Solana a2a payment`, `x402 SDK for Solana`, `BLOCKSUB`, `LinkWave`, `Bundl`, and `DePlan` show repeated hackathon interest. |
| Archive Backing | 8.0 | Strong external narrative support. | Copilot archives returned a16z, Galaxy, Pantera, and Superteam materials that explicitly discuss agent payments, batching, x402, and stablecoin commerce. |
| Builder Density at Intersection | 6.0 | Moderate. Enough activity to validate the need, not so much that the merchant layer is closed. | The surrounding clusters are crowded, but the exact intersection of `agent payments + merchant billing + operational tooling` still looks thin. |

## Brutal read

This is not a blue ocean.

If Decimal pitches:

> "we do agent payments on Solana"

then the score drops immediately, because Copilot already shows enough adjacent projects that this sounds generic.

If Decimal pitches:

> "we are the Stripe-like merchant operating layer for crypto-native agent billing"

then the score improves, because that is where the Copilot results are notably thinner.

The strongest interpretation is:

- protocols and rails are being built
- subscriptions and recurring billing experiments exist
- merchant wrappers and payment gateways exist
- but the `merchant operating layer` is still weakly represented

That means the product can work, but only if it is brutally specific.

## What would weaken the idea

- becoming just another payment rail
- becoming just another x402 wrapper
- becoming just another recurring subscription SDK
- focusing on consumer checkout instead of merchant operations

## What would strengthen the idea

- make integration dead simple for businesses
- support both one-shot and metered agent billing
- own billing state, proof, reconciliation, and exceptions
- make entitlements and merchant-facing operations first-class
- stay protocol-agnostic enough to compose MPP and x402 rather than fighting them

## Bottom line

Current score:

- `7.0/10` as a product direction

Why not higher:

- the surrounding market is already active
- the story becomes weak fast if it drifts into generic “agent payments”

Why still good:

- the merchant operating layer is still meaningfully underbuilt
- archive and protocol momentum say timing is real
- the product cut is coherent if Decimal avoids the protocol trap

## Recommended next framing

Do not frame Decimal as:

> agent payments infrastructure

Frame Decimal as:

> the merchant operating system for crypto-native agent billing

That is the sharper category and the only version that looks defensible from the Copilot dataset.
