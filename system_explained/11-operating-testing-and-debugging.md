# 11 Operating Testing And Debugging

This file explains how to run, test, and debug Axoria locally.

## Start Everything

```bash
make dev
```

This starts:

- Postgres
- ClickHouse
- API
- frontend
- Yellowstone worker if configured

## Start Infrastructure Only

```bash
make infra-up
```

Use this when running API/frontend manually.

## Run Tests

```bash
make test
```

Individual:

```bash
make test-api
make test-worker
make test-frontend
```

## Current Test Coverage

API tests include:

- API contract.
- ClickHouse integration.
- Control plane workflow.
- Payment orders.
- Payment run state.
- Transfer request lifecycle.

Frontend tests are present through the frontend test command.

Worker tests run through Cargo if Rust tests exist in the crate.

## Health Checks

API health endpoints are public.

Ops health endpoints are workspace-scoped and protected.

Use ops health to understand:

- worker freshness
- API route health
- matching latency
- exception counts
- ClickHouse reachability

## Debug A Payment That Did Not Settle

Work through this checklist.

### 1. Check Payment Order

In API/frontend:

- Does the payment order exist?
- Is it approved?
- Does it have a destination?
- Does it have a source wallet if expected?
- Does it have a transfer request?
- Does it have a submitted signature?

### 2. Check Matching Index

Confirm the worker knows about it.

Questions:

- Did the API emit a matching-index refresh event?
- Did the worker log a new matching-index version?
- Does the index include the transfer request?
- Does the index include the submitted signature?
- Does the index include the destination token account/wallet?

### 3. Check Solana Transaction

Questions:

- Did the transaction confirm?
- Was it mainnet/devnet consistent with the worker endpoint?
- Was it USDC mint expected by Axoria?
- Did it transfer to the intended token account/wallet?
- Was the amount raw value correct?

### 4. Check ClickHouse

Query by signature:

```sql
SELECT * FROM observed_transactions WHERE signature = '<signature>';
SELECT * FROM observed_transfers WHERE signature = '<signature>';
SELECT * FROM observed_payments WHERE signature = '<signature>';
```

Query matches:

```sql
SELECT * FROM settlement_matches WHERE has(matched_signatures, '<signature>');
```

### 5. Check Exceptions

```sql
SELECT * FROM exceptions WHERE signature = '<signature>';
```

Then check API exception overlays.

## Debug Repeated Matching Index Refreshes

Repeated logs:

```text
Matching index refreshed to version N.
```

mean the worker received refresh events or refreshed on startup/reconnect.

If it refreshes constantly:

- inspect API mutation traffic
- inspect matching-index invalidation middleware
- inspect frontend polling/mutations
- inspect SSE reconnect behavior

The worker should not need polling to stay fresh.

## Debug Repeated Unknown Address Noise

The old Orb label resolver was removed. If unknown addresses are noisy again, the correct fix is not to reintroduce remote label lookups in the hot path.

Correct behavior should be:

- use workspace labels first
- use saved wallet/destination labels first
- cache negative Orb result
- avoid repeated log spam

## Debug CORS

Local frontend may run on different ports.

The API should allow localhost/127.0.0.1 dev origins.

If a browser request fails with CORS:

- check method is allowed
- check route exists
- check CORS config includes method
- check API server actually restarted after changes

## Debug Wallet Signing

If sign/submit fails:

- verify browser wallet is installed
- verify correct wallet is selected
- verify selected public key equals required signer
- verify RPC endpoint is reachable
- verify recent blockhash can be fetched
- verify transaction is built with correct accounts
- verify source wallet has USDC token account and balance

The frontend uses configured RPC. A 403 from RPC means provider access issue, not necessarily an Axoria transaction bug.

## Debug CSV Import

Expected header:

```csv
counterparty,destination,amount,reference,due_date
```

`counterparty` is optional human-readable context. `destination` is the external Solana wallet address of the recipient. Re-importing the same CSV returns the existing `PaymentRun` with `importResult.imported: 0` (idempotent by fingerprint); the frontend surfaces this as an error toast ("This CSV was already imported as …").

If import does nothing:

- open browser console
- check network request
- check API validation error
- verify button handler submits correctly
- verify backend route accepts body shape
- verify destination/wallet validation rules

## Reset Local Data

```bash
make reset-data
```

This deletes local Docker volumes and restarts clean.

Only use when intentionally discarding local state.

## Development Safety Rules

- Do not change payment lifecycle states without tests.
- Do not change matcher allocation behavior without tests.
- Do not change proof packet shape without checking consumers.
- Do not change API route paths without updating `api-contract.ts`.
- Do not make frontend the only place where business rules exist.
- Do not store all observed world data just because the stream has it.
