# Frontend Handoff: Squads v4 Treasury Creation

Owner: Claude Code / frontend
Backend status: ready for integration
Scope: create a Squads v4 treasury wallet for an organization and persist the Squads vault PDA as a Decimal treasury account.

## Current Backend State

The backend now supports the first Squads tranche:

- Prepare a Squads v4 multisig creation transaction.
- Let a Privy-backed personal signing wallet sign the prepared transaction.
- Confirm the onchain Squads multisig and store its vault PDA as an organization treasury wallet.
- Read live Squads status for a stored Squads treasury.

This does not yet create payment proposals through Squads. It only creates the treasury account that later payment execution will use.

## Product Model

Use these terms in the UI:

- Personal wallet: the user's individual signing wallet. This is usually Privy embedded now.
- Treasury wallet: organization-owned money account that Decimal monitors.
- Squads treasury: a treasury wallet backed by a Squads v4 multisig. Decimal stores the vault PDA as the treasury address and the multisig PDA as metadata.

Important distinction:

- A personal wallet belongs to a user.
- A Squads treasury belongs to the organization.
- Personal wallets become Squads members, but they are not themselves treasury wallets.

## Desired UX

Build this into the treasury wallets area, not the personal wallet area.

Recommended entry point:

- Page: organization treasury wallets page.
- Primary CTA: `Create Squads treasury`.
- Existing manual `Add treasury account` can remain secondary as `Add existing treasury address`.

Flow:

1. User opens `Create Squads treasury`.
2. UI checks the user has at least one active personal Solana wallet.
3. User chooses a display name.
4. User chooses Squads members from personal wallets owned by active organization members.
5. User chooses permissions and threshold.
6. UI calls `create-intent`.
7. UI shows review screen with multisig PDA, vault PDA, members, threshold, and required signer.
8. UI asks the backend to sign the returned transaction with the required Privy personal wallet.
9. UI submits the returned signed transaction to Solana.
10. UI calls `confirm` with the submitted transaction signature and intent details.
11. UI refreshes treasury wallets and shows the new Squads treasury.

MVP default:

- If the current user has exactly one personal wallet, default to a 1-of-1 Squads treasury.
- Permissions for that wallet: `initiate`, `vote`, `execute`.
- Threshold: `1`.
- Timelock: `0`.
- Vault index: `0`.

Do not expose config authority. Backend creates autonomous Squads treasuries only.

## Existing Frontend Context

Relevant current files:

- `frontend/src/pages/Wallets.tsx`: treasury accounts UI.
- `frontend/src/api.ts`: API client wrapper.
- `frontend/src/types.ts`: shared frontend types.
- `frontend/src/lib/solana-wallet.ts`: existing Solana wallet discovery/signing helpers.

Current signing helper handles legacy `Transaction` payment packets. Squads returns a serialized `VersionedTransaction`, so add a small dedicated helper instead of forcing the existing payment packet builder to fit this flow.

## API Endpoints

All routes require the existing session auth token.

### List Personal Wallets

Use existing endpoint:

```http
GET /personal-wallets
```

Response shape already exists in `UserWallet`.

Use only active Solana wallets:

```ts
wallet.status === 'active' && wallet.chain === 'solana'
```

### Create Squads Treasury Intent

```http
POST /organizations/:organizationId/treasury-wallets/squads/create-intent
```

Request:

```ts
type CreateSquadsTreasuryIntentRequest = {
  displayName?: string | null;
  creatorPersonalWalletId: string;
  threshold: number;
  timeLockSeconds?: number;
  vaultIndex?: number;
  members: Array<{
    personalWalletId: string;
    permissions: Array<'initiate' | 'vote' | 'execute'>;
  }>;
};
```

Response:

```ts
type CreateSquadsTreasuryIntentResponse = {
  intent: {
    provider: 'squads_v4';
    programId: string;
    createKey: string;
    multisigPda: string;
    vaultPda: string;
    vaultIndex: number;
    threshold: number;
    timeLockSeconds: number;
    displayName: string | null;
    members: Array<{
      personalWalletId: string;
      walletAddress: string;
      userId: string;
      membershipId: string;
      permissions: Array<'initiate' | 'vote' | 'execute'>;
    }>;
  };
  transaction: {
    encoding: 'base64';
    serializedTransaction: string;
    requiredSigner: string;
    recentBlockhash: string;
    lastValidBlockHeight: number;
  };
};
```

Validation errors to surface cleanly:

- `creatorPersonalWalletId must be included as a Squads member.`
- `creatorPersonalWalletId must belong to the authenticated user.`
- `Every Squads member must be an active Solana personal wallet.`
- `Every Squads member wallet owner must be an active organization member.`
- `threshold cannot exceed the number of voting Squads members.`
- `At least one Squads member must have initiate permission.`
- `At least one Squads member must have vote permission.`
- `At least one Squads member must have execute permission.`
- `Squads treasury wallet already exists in this organization.`

### Sign Prepared Versioned Transaction

```http
POST /personal-wallets/:userWalletId/sign-versioned-transaction
```

Request:

```ts
type SignVersionedTransactionRequest = {
  serializedTransactionBase64: string;
};
```

Response:

```ts
type SignVersionedTransactionResponse = {
  userWalletId: string;
  walletAddress: string;
  signedTransactionBase64: string;
  encoding: 'base64';
};
```

Backend behavior:

- Requires session auth.
- The wallet must belong to the authenticated user.
- The wallet must be an active Privy embedded Solana personal wallet.
- The transaction must be a valid serialized Solana `VersionedTransaction`.
- The personal wallet address must be one of the transaction's required signers.
- For now, the transaction must include the Squads v4 program. This intentionally prevents this from becoming a generic blind-signing endpoint too early.

Frontend behavior:

- Call this after `create-intent`.
- Use `transaction.requiredSigner` from the intent response to pick the matching personal wallet.
- Do not submit the unsigned transaction.
- Submit `signedTransactionBase64` to Solana with `sendRawTransaction`.

### Confirm Squads Treasury

```http
POST /organizations/:organizationId/treasury-wallets/squads/confirm
```

Request:

```ts
type ConfirmSquadsTreasuryRequest = {
  signature: string;
  displayName?: string | null;
  createKey: string;
  multisigPda: string;
  vaultIndex?: number;
};
```

Response is a `TreasuryWallet`:

```ts
type TreasuryWallet = {
  treasuryWalletId: string;
  organizationId: string;
  chain: string;
  address: string;       // Squads vault PDA
  assetScope: string;
  usdcAtaAddress: string | null;
  isActive: boolean;
  source: 'squads_v4' | string;
  sourceRef: string | null; // Squads multisig PDA
  displayName: string | null;
  notes: string | null;
  propertiesJson: Record<string, unknown>;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
};
```

### Squads Treasury Status

```http
GET /organizations/:organizationId/treasury-wallets/:treasuryWalletId/squads/status
```

Response:

```ts
type SquadsTreasuryStatus = {
  treasuryWalletId: string;
  provider: 'squads_v4';
  programId: string;
  multisigPda: string;
  vaultPda: string;
  vaultIndex: number;
  threshold: number;
  timeLockSeconds: number;
  transactionIndex: string;
  staleTransactionIndex: string;
  members: Array<{
    walletAddress: string;
    permissionsMask: number;
    permissions: Array<'initiate' | 'vote' | 'execute'>;
  }>;
  localStateMatchesChain: boolean;
};
```

Use this in a details panel or row expansion for Squads treasury accounts.

## Frontend API Client Additions

Add these methods to `frontend/src/api.ts`:

```ts
createSquadsTreasuryIntent(
  organizationId: string,
  input: CreateSquadsTreasuryIntentRequest,
) {
  return request<CreateSquadsTreasuryIntentResponse>(
    `/organizations/${organizationId}/treasury-wallets/squads/create-intent`,
    {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify(input),
    },
  );
}

confirmSquadsTreasury(
  organizationId: string,
  input: ConfirmSquadsTreasuryRequest,
) {
  return request<TreasuryWallet>(
    `/organizations/${organizationId}/treasury-wallets/squads/confirm`,
    {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify(input),
    },
  );
}

signPersonalWalletVersionedTransaction(
  userWalletId: string,
  input: SignVersionedTransactionRequest,
) {
  return request<SignVersionedTransactionResponse>(
    `/personal-wallets/${userWalletId}/sign-versioned-transaction`,
    {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify(input),
    },
  );
}

getSquadsTreasuryStatus(organizationId: string, treasuryWalletId: string) {
  return request<SquadsTreasuryStatus>(
    `/organizations/${organizationId}/treasury-wallets/${treasuryWalletId}/squads/status`,
  );
}
```

Add the corresponding types in `frontend/src/types.ts`.

## Signing and Submission

The backend returns a base64 serialized `VersionedTransaction` that is already partially signed by the backend-generated Squads `createKey`.

The frontend must:

1. Call `signPersonalWalletVersionedTransaction` with the creator personal wallet ID.
2. Decode `signedTransactionBase64`.
3. Submit the signed bytes with `connection.sendRawTransaction`.
4. Confirm the transaction.
5. Call backend `confirm`.

Suggested helper:

```ts
import {
  Connection,
} from '@solana/web3.js';
import { getPublicSolanaRpcUrl } from '../public-config';

export async function submitSignedVersionedTransaction(input: {
  signedTransactionBase64: string;
  recentBlockhash: string;
  lastValidBlockHeight: number;
}) {
  const connection = new Connection(getPublicSolanaRpcUrl(), 'confirmed');
  const bytes = Uint8Array.from(atob(input.signedTransactionBase64), (char) => char.charCodeAt(0));

  const signature = await connection.sendRawTransaction(bytes, {
    skipPreflight: false,
    preflightCommitment: 'confirmed',
  });

  await connection.confirmTransaction(
    {
      signature,
      blockhash: input.recentBlockhash,
      lastValidBlockHeight: input.lastValidBlockHeight,
    },
    'confirmed',
  );

  return signature;
}
```

Implementation note:

- Do not rebuild Squads instructions in the frontend.
- Do not install `@sqds/multisig` in the frontend for this tranche.
- Use the unsigned transaction exactly as returned by `create-intent`.
- Use the signed transaction exactly as returned by the new personal-wallet signing endpoint.
- Preserve the backend `createKey` partial signature. Do not recreate or replace the transaction.

## Component Flow

Recommended component structure:

```txt
WalletsPage
  CreateSquadsTreasuryDialog
    StepMembers
    StepPolicy
    StepReview
    StepSignAndConfirm
```

State shape:

```ts
type SquadsTreasuryDraft = {
  displayName: string;
  creatorPersonalWalletId: string;
  threshold: number;
  timeLockSeconds: number;
  vaultIndex: number;
  members: Array<{
    personalWalletId: string;
    permissions: Array<'initiate' | 'vote' | 'execute'>;
  }>;
};

type PendingSquadsIntent = CreateSquadsTreasuryIntentResponse & {
  submittedSignature?: string;
};
```

Mutation sequence:

```txt
createIntent -> backend sign -> submit signed transaction -> confirm -> invalidate treasury queries
```

Invalidate these query keys after confirmation:

- `['treasury-wallet-balances', organizationId]`
- `['treasury-wallets', organizationId]` if present
- `['addresses', organizationId]` if still used by the address book
- `['organization-summary', organizationId]` if present

## UI Details

Create dialog copy:

- Title: `Create Squads treasury`
- Body: `Create an organization treasury controlled by selected member wallets. Decimal will monitor the Squads vault and use it as the source wallet for payments.`

Review screen fields:

- Treasury name
- Threshold, for example `1 of 1` or `2 of 3`
- Required signer
- Multisig address
- Treasury vault address
- Members and permissions

Treasury table:

- For `source === 'squads_v4'`, show a `Squads` badge.
- Address column should show `address`, which is the vault PDA.
- Add small secondary text or details drawer for `sourceRef`, which is the multisig PDA.

Empty state:

- If no personal wallet exists:
  - Title: `Create your signing wallet first`
  - Body: `A Squads treasury needs at least one personal wallet as a member. Create a Privy signing wallet from the wallet setup flow first.`
  - CTA: route to personal wallet setup/profile if available.

## Error Handling

Handle these states explicitly:

- No personal wallet: block treasury creation until a personal wallet exists.
- User rejects wallet signature: keep the intent on screen and allow retry.
- Selected wallet mismatch: tell user the required signer and ask them to select the matching personal wallet.
- Blockhash expired: show `Transaction expired. Prepare again.` and rerun `create-intent`.
- Transaction submitted but backend confirm failed: keep the signature and show `Retry confirmation`.
- Backend says treasury already exists: refresh treasury wallets and close the dialog.

Do not silently reset the flow after a failed confirmation. The signature is valuable and should be reusable for retry.

## Minimal Happy Path Test

Use this local flow:

1. Sign in.
2. Create organization.
3. Create/register one Privy personal wallet.
4. Go to treasury wallets.
5. Click `Create Squads treasury`.
6. Use default 1-of-1 settings.
7. Create intent.
8. Sign with the required personal wallet.
9. Confirm.
10. Verify a new treasury row appears with:
    - `source: squads_v4`
    - `address`: Squads vault PDA
    - `sourceRef`: Squads multisig PDA
    - `usdcAtaAddress`: non-null

Optional check:

1. Open the Squads status panel.
2. Call status endpoint.
3. Confirm `localStateMatchesChain === true`.

## Out of Scope

Do not implement these in this UI tranche:

- Squads payment proposal creation.
- Voting on Squads proposals.
- Executing Squads proposals.
- Importing existing Squads multisigs.
- Changing Squads members.
- Changing threshold.
- Custom config authority.
- Non-Squads custody providers.

Those are separate backend tranches.

## Backend Verification Already Done

The backend tranche was verified with:

```bash
npm run build
make test-api
```

API tests cover the create intent, confirm, and status path with mocked Squads runtime.
